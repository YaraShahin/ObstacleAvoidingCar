# ObstacleAvoidingCar
## ******A)	Planing this project consisted of 3 main stages 
-researching algorithms 
-trials 
-error testing

**I and my teammate started by deciding which algorithm we should use then after we decided we started working on git hub where each one of us picked where the other one stopped in the introduction part where we just wanted the robot to reach the goal point after that we started testing different types of code for the obstacle avoidance where some didn’t work out but with the experience my teammate has she found the perfect code that would exactly do the job with minimal errors and started to divide the job between both of us where each carried out a part while my team supervised my part and kept regularly testing and running it
##  ******B)This project consists of multiple inputs  
**-X and Y axis of the robot initial point
-X and Y axis of the target where we want the robot to reach
-Number of obstacles inside the map 
-the size of the robot itself 
-while assuming the robot is square declare its sides
-from inside the code itself change the robot picture itself inside the map **
## ******B) While the expected out put is 
**-the map containing the obstacles , robot, target point
-robot doing its operation
-once the robot reaches the target it prints out “it reaches the target”
-if error happens during the robot trying to reach the target it prints “I gotta put me firstttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt”**
## ******C)The software that have been used to finish this project was 
**-python version 3.10.4
**- ubuntu version 18.04 LTS
**- Virtual box
**- Robotics toolbox
**- visual studio code
**- math library
**- mat plot library
**- terminal
**- git hub
